# Player List Grid Search Interaction Specification

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed behavioral requirements for the search functionality in the PlayerListGrid component.

## Core Interaction Requirements

### Search Bar Display
1. Initial State
   - Search bar is always visible
   - Search icon shown when field is empty
   - Clear (X) icon shown when field has text

2. Visual Feedback
   - Search bar maintains consistent width
   - Clear visual distinction between empty and active states
   - Smooth transitions for icon changes

### Search Query Handling
1. Dynamic Search
   - Search results update in real-time as the user types
   - No page or component refresh during search
   - Smooth, non-jarring UI transitions

2. Clear Button (X Icon)
   - Appears when search field contains text
   - Clicking the X button:
     * Clears the search field
     * Resets search results to original state
   - Search icon reappears after clearing

### Focus and Interaction
1. Focus Management
   - Input field receives focus when clicked
   - Maintains focus while typing
   - Proper keyboard navigation support

2. Search Experience
   - Immediate feedback as user types
   - Clear visual indication of search state
   - Smooth transitions between states

## Technical Implementation Considerations
- Use React state for search query management
- Implement debounce for search query to optimize performance
- Ensure proper event handling for input interactions
- Maintain accessibility standards

## Rationale
This simplified interaction pattern:
- Provides a straightforward, always-available search interface
- Reduces complexity in the UI
- Maintains core search functionality without the added complexity of expansion/collapse behavior

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding expand/collapse behavior once core functionality is solid
- Implement search history
- Add advanced filtering options
- Add keyboard shortcuts for search

## Version History
- Initial Specification: February 13, 2025
- Version 1.0.0: Original specification with expand/collapse behavior
- Version 1.1.0: Simplified to always-visible search bar (current)

## Component
- PlayerListGrid
