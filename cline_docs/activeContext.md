# Active Context

## Current Development Focus
- Production deployment pipeline
- Frontend-backend integration
- DataGrid component implementation and debugging

## Recent Changes
1. API Response Standardization:
   - Created ApiResponse<T> wrapper class
   - Standardized API response format
   - Fixed frontend data display issue
   - Verified player list functionality

2. Player Model and API:
   - Fixed MongoDB Id handling in Player model
   - Made Id property nullable to work with MongoDB auto-generation
   - Successfully tested player creation and retrieval
   - Verified proper Id generation and persistence
   - Documented proper model validation behavior

2. Docker Configuration:
   - Created docker-compose.dev.yml for development
   - Created docker-compose.yml for production
   - Added Dockerfile.dev and Dockerfile.prod for frontend
   - Configured Nginx as reverse proxy
   - Set up volume mappings and port forwarding
   - Successfully tested development environment setup
   - Verified container communication and MongoDB persistence

2. Environment Configuration:
   - Added .env.development and .env.production
   - Created .env.example for documentation
   - Updated .gitignore for environment files
   - Configured consistent port usage
   - Validated environment configurations

3. API Configuration:
   - Updated CORS settings for both environments
   - Added API prefix handling for production
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - MongoDB connection configuration
   - Investigated and documented .NET Core configuration patterns:
     * appsettings.json uses colon notation (MongoDB:ConnectionString)
     * Environment variables require double underscore (MongoDB__ConnectionString)
     * Both formats are equivalent in code configuration access
   - Verified frontend-backend communication

## Common Mistakes and Lessons Learned
1. API Response Structure:
   - Frontend expected wrapped response with 'value' property
   - API was returning direct data
   - Lesson: Maintain consistent response structure
   - Lesson: Consider frontend expectations when designing API

2. MongoDB Id Handling:
   - Initially used non-nullable Id property which conflicted with MongoDB auto-generation
   - Model validation was preventing null Id values before reaching MongoDB
   - Fixed by making Id property nullable in Player model
   - Lesson: When using MongoDB's auto-generated Ids, ensure model properties are nullable
   - Lesson: Consider validation behavior when designing models with auto-generated fields

2. JSON Response Handling:
   - Incorrectly reported missing commas in JSON responses without properly reading the output
   - Made unnecessary changes to JSON serialization based on this misreading
   - Added complexity that wasn't needed since the JSON was properly formatted
   - Lesson: Always carefully read and verify the actual response content before making assumptions
   - Lesson: Double-check output formatting before suggesting fixes for non-existent problems

2. Command Line Syntax:
   - Used Unix command syntax instead of Windows PowerShell
   - Lesson: Always use PowerShell syntax when working in Windows environment
   - Example: Use `Invoke-WebRequest` instead of `curl` for HTTP requests

## Next Steps
1. Immediate Tasks
   - Revert unnecessary JSON serialization changes
   - Fix DataGrid position column implementation
   - Test production deployment configuration

2. Future Tasks
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Add health checks
   - Configure container logging

## Implementation Strategy
1. Phase 1 - Development Environment ✓
   - Test Docker Compose setup ✓
   - Verify hot reloading ✓
   - Test API communication ✓
   - Validate MongoDB connection ✓

2. Phase 2 - Production Environment
   - Test Nginx configuration
   - Verify static file serving
   - Test API routing
   - Validate environment variables

## Current Questions
- Production deployment strategy
- CI/CD pipeline requirements
- Backup and persistence strategy
- Monitoring and logging approach
