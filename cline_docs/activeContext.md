   - Successfully tested player creation and retrieval
   - Verified proper Id generation and persistence
   - Documented proper model validation behavior

9. Docker Configuration:
   - Created docker-compose.dev.yml for development
   - Created docker-compose.yml for production
   - Added Dockerfile.dev and Dockerfile.prod for frontend
   - Configured Nginx as reverse proxy
   - Set up volume mappings and port forwarding
   - Successfully tested development environment setup

10. Environment Configuration:
   - Added .env.development and .env.production

   - Validated environment configurations

11. API Configuration:
   - Updated CORS settings for both environments
   - Added API prefix handling for production
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - MongoDB connection configuration
   - Investigated and documented .NET Core configuration patterns:
     * appsettings.json uses colon notation (MongoDB:ConnectionString)
     * Environment variables require double underscore (MongoDB__ConnectionString)
     * Both formats are equivalent in code configuration access
   - Verified frontend-backend communication

12. Delete All Endpoint: (1/31/25)
    - Added DeleteAll endpoint and DeleteAllAsync method
    - Initially encountered 404 error with /player/deleteall route
    - Investigated potential route casing and configuration issues
    - Found that API container wasn't picking up code changes with just restart
    - Resolution: Required full rebuild with `docker compose up -d --build api`
    - Endpoint now working and visible in Swagger
    - Delete all functionality confirmed working in admin panel

## Common Mistakes and Lessons Learned
1. React Router Integration:
   - Issue: Incorrect usage of Material-UI with React Router components
   - Solution: Use React Router's Link component directly instead of aliasing
   - Lesson: When integrating Material-UI with React Router:
     * Use Link component directly from react-router-dom
     * Wrap Material-UI components with Link when needed
     * Keep routing logic separate from UI components

2. React Hooks Rules:
   - Issue: Hooks were being called conditionally, causing order changes between renders
   - Solution: Moved all hooks to top level of component
   - Lesson: Always follow React's rules of hooks:
     * Only call hooks at the top level
     * Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
     * Keep hook order consistent between renders
   - Lesson: Handle conditional rendering in the JSX return statement, not by returning early with hooks

3. API Response Structure:
   - Frontend expected wrapped response with 'value' property
   - API was returning direct data
   - Lesson: Maintain consistent response structure
   - Lesson: Consider frontend expectations when designing API

4. MongoDB Id Handling:
   - Initially used non-nullable Id property which conflicted with MongoDB auto-generation
   - Model validation was preventing null Id values before reaching MongoDB
   - Fixed by making Id property nullable in Player model
   - Lesson: When using MongoDB's auto-generated Ids, ensure model properties are nullable
   - Lesson: Consider validation behavior when designing models with auto-generated fields

5. JSON Response Handling:
   - Incorrectly reported missing commas in JSON responses without properly reading the output
   - Made unnecessary changes to JSON serialization based on this misreading
   - Added complexity that wasn't needed since the JSON was properly formatted
   - Lesson: Always carefully read and verify the actual response content before making assumptions
   - Lesson: Double-check output formatting before suggesting fixes for non-existent problems

6. Command Line Syntax:
   - Used Unix command syntax instead of Windows PowerShell
   - Used outdated `docker-compose` instead of `docker compose`
   - Lesson: Always use PowerShell syntax when working in Windows environment
   - Lesson: Use `docker compose` (with a space) as it's the newer, recommended syntax
   - Example: Use `Invoke-WebRequest` instead of `curl` for HTTP requests
   - Example: Use `docker compose up` instead of `docker-compose up`

7. ASP.NET Core Routing:
   - Issue: 404 error with deleteall endpoint despite correct implementation
   - Investigation: Noticed potential casing issue with [Route("[controller]")] and LowercaseUrls option
   - Lesson: Pay attention to ASP.NET Core's route transformation settings
   - Lesson: Consider explicit lowercase routes when using LowercaseUrls option

8. Docker Development Workflow:
   - Issue: API changes not reflecting after container restart
   - Root Cause: Container needs rebuild to pick up C# code changes
   - Solution: Use `docker compose up -d --build api` instead of just restart
   - Lesson: Always rebuild API container when making C# code changes
   - Lesson: Don't assume container restart will pick up all code changes

9. Hot Reload Limitations:
   - Issue: MissingMethodException when removing endpoints during hot reload
   - Root Cause: Hot reload cannot handle method deletion while app is running
   - Solution: Restart container when removing endpoints
   - Lesson: Hot reload works well for additions and modifications
   - Lesson: Use container restart for structural changes like method removal
