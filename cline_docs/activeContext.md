## Common Mistakes and Lessons Learned

1. Memory Bank Script Usage:
    - Use updateMemoryBank.js script for all Memory Bank updates:
      * cd scripts
      * node updateMemoryBank.js add "filename" "section name" $(Get-Content entry.txt -Raw)
      * node updateMemoryBank.js delete "filename" "section name" entry_number
      * Examples:
        - Add to Recent Changes: add "activeContext.md" "Recent Changes" "content"
        - Add to Recent Achievements: add "progress.md" "Recent Achievements" "content"
      * Verify changes in specified file
    - Create entry content in a text file:
      * Follow existing format (indentation, bullets)
      * Include date in title (e.g., Feature Name (2/7/25))
      * Save as .txt file in scripts directory
    - Script handles:
      * Adding new entry as #1
      * Incrementing existing entries
      * Preserving formatting
      * Maintaining whitespace
    - Benefits:
      * Eliminates manual renumbering
      * Reduces formatting errors
      * Makes updates more reliable
      * Preserves documentation structure

2. React Router Integration:
   - Issue: Incorrect usage of Material-UI with React Router components
   - Solution: Use React Router's Link component directly instead of aliasing
   - Lesson: When integrating Material-UI with React Router:
     * Use Link component directly from react-router-dom
     * Wrap Material-UI components with Link when needed
     * Keep routing logic separate from UI components
3. React Hooks Rules:
   - Issue: Hooks were being called conditionally, causing order changes between renders
   - Solution: Moved all hooks to top level of component
   - Lesson: Always follow React's rules of hooks:
     * Only call hooks at the top level
     * Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
     * Keep hook order consistent between renders
   - Lesson: Handle conditional rendering in the JSX return statement, not by returning early with hooks
4. API Response Structure:
   - Frontend expected wrapped response with 'value' property
   - API was returning direct data
   - Lesson: Maintain consistent response structure
   - Lesson: Consider frontend expectations when designing API
5. MongoDB Id Handling:
   - Initially used non-nullable Id property which conflicted with MongoDB auto-generation
   - Model validation was preventing null Id values before reaching MongoDB
   - Fixed by making Id property nullable in Player model
   - Lesson: When using MongoDB's auto-generated Ids, ensure model properties are nullable
   - Lesson: Consider validation behavior when designing models with auto-generated fields
6. JSON Response Handling:
   - Incorrectly reported missing commas in JSON responses without properly reading the output
   - Made unnecessary changes to JSON serialization based on this misreading
   - Added complexity that wasn't needed since the JSON was properly formatted
   - Lesson: Always carefully read and verify the actual response content before making assumptions
   - Lesson: Double-check output formatting before suggesting fixes for non-existent problems
7. Command Line Syntax:
   - Used Unix command syntax instead of Windows PowerShell
   - Used outdated `docker-compose` instead of `docker compose`
   - Lesson: Always use PowerShell syntax when working in Windows environment
   - Lesson: Use `docker compose` (with a space) as it's the newer, recommended syntax
   - Example: Use `Invoke-WebRequest` instead of `curl` for HTTP requests
   - Example: Use `docker compose up` instead of `docker-compose up`
8. ASP.NET Core Routing:
   - Issue: 404 error with deleteall endpoint despite correct implementation
   - Investigation: Noticed potential casing issue with [Route("[controller]")] and LowercaseUrls option
   - Lesson: Pay attention to ASP.NET Core's route transformation settings
   - Lesson: Consider explicit lowercase routes when using LowercaseUrls option
9. Docker Development Workflow:
   - Issue: API changes not reflecting after container restart
   - Root Cause: Container needs rebuild to pick up C# code changes
   - Solution: Use `docker compose up -d --build api` instead of just restart
   - Lesson: Always rebuild API container when making C# code changes
   - Lesson: Don't assume container restart will pick up all code changes
10. Hot Reload Limitations:
   - Issue: MissingMethodException when removing endpoints during hot reload
   - Root Cause: Hot reload cannot handle method deletion while app is running
   - Solution: Restart container when removing endpoints
   - Lesson: Hot reload works well for additions and modifications
   - Lesson: Use container restart for structural changes like method removal
11. Duplicate Player Detection:
    - Issue: Same player could be imported multiple times with different data
    - Root Cause: No unique constraint on player identification
    - Solution: 
      * Use compound index on name + birthDate for reliable matching
      * Implement smart merge logic to preserve existing data
      * Use dictionary fields for extensible external IDs
    - Lesson: Consider data merging strategy when implementing duplicate detection
    - Lesson: Use compound indexes for more reliable duplicate detection than single field
12. Memory Bank Maintenance:
    - Issue: Accidentally deleted content from memory bank files when using [Previous content remains unchanged...] placeholders
    - Root Cause: Misinterpreted git diff notation as actual content to keep
    - Impact: Lost important historical context and documentation
    - Solution:
      * Retrieved content from git history
      * Restored complete documentation
      * Added proper section organization
    - Lessons:
      * Never replace existing content with placeholder text
      * Always verify content before deletion
      * Keep backups of critical documentation
      * Use version control to track documentation changes
      * When updating files, add new content while preserving existing content
    - Recent Changes Section Management:
      * When adding a new entry to Recent Changes:
        - Add new entry as #1
        - Use replace_in_file to update ALL existing entry numbers
        - Create one SEARCH/REPLACE block per number to change
        - Process all numbers in a single replace_in_file operation
        - Verify all numbers are properly incremented
      * When updating progress.md:
        - Add new features to Completed Features section first
        - Add new issues to Known Issues section
        - Add new entry as #1 in Recent Achievements
        - Increment ALL existing achievement numbers (e.g., 1-11 become 2-12)
        - Process all changes in a single replace_in_file operation
        - Verify all sections are properly updated
